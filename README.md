A Telegram listener made with Python. Used pytesseract for extracting text from an image.
While running, the program listens to a user-specified channel and a person in the channel, when the person sends an image to that channel, the program will download the image, extract the words,
compairs them to user-defined keywords and if they are the same, sends the image to a user-specified Telegram channel.
